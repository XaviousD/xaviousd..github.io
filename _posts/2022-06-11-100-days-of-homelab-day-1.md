# DAY 1

So Day 1 was more of a combination of 3 days of things so I could get a domain up and running and Jekyll Setup.  Thankfully it wasn\'t to bad

* **[COMPLETE]** Setup/Register Domain (hyperionmedia.us)

## Potential Day 2 Timeline

* Setup a coding environment on my windows machine to be able to code/utilize github
* Setup/Establish github pages for hyperionmedia.us
* Research/Setup hyperionmedia.us email server
