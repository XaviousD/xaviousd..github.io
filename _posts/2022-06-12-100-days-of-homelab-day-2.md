# DAY 2

Day 2 Started off pretty good.  Had a few hickups with Pi-Hole blocking the Microsoft Store which slowed down getting VSCode and the Microsoft WSL Setup while following @technotim's video https://docs.technotim.live/posts/windows-developer-setup/ 

* [COMPLETE] Setup a coding environment on my windows machine to be able to code/utilize github

## Potential Day 3 Timeline
