# DAY 3

Day 3 Was a LONG Day.  With the help of my fellow homelabbers in discord we were able to makesure my github pages were running on https://www.hyperionmedia.us
Then after a few hours Jekyll was setup locally to be able to edit the content.

I would like to run my own email server, but after talking with others, the typical issues preventing this (ISP's Block the ports needed 90% of the time) I decided to utilize CloudFlares email forwarding service and created my xaviousd@hyperionmedia.us email when you can now email.  This is routed through to my gmail account.

Perhaps later on during the challenge we can revisit that part of my To-Do List and see if we can improve it.

* **[COMPLETE]** Setup/Establish github pages for hyperionmedia.us
* **[COMPLETE]** Setup and Learn Jekyll Static Site following @technotim's Latest Video
* **[COMPLETE]** Research/Setup hyperionmedia.us email server
