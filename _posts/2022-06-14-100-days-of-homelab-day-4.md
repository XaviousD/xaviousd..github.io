# DAY 4

Day 4 is the day I lost more hair.  After a long night of sitting at my work desk doing absolutely nothing due to IT Issues 7am came and I went to sleep.  Woke up, called ITSupport and got that working after a few outers.  I've managed to get up to this entry in the Blog.  Haven't published out to the website but the day is young.
