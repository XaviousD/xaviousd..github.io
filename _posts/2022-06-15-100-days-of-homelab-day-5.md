# DAY 5

So as a Vampire (I work 11pm - 7am) I dont see much sunlight.  Just like the past few days since technotim created his 100DaysofHomeLab challege, i've woken up and ran to work on some task/project for the day.  I must say its really awesome seeing everyone embracing this.

I've never been one for the social media platforms as well, and I must say,  I hopped on to update some images and I saw people were following me and liking my tweets etc.  I kinda got a fuzzy feelin`', not gonna lie.  Anyway todays list is below!  Lets rock this joint!

* [IN-PROGRESS] Publish Jekyll out to github and get the website actually filled with content instead of placeholder text.
* [IN-PROGRESS] Figure out if theres some type of addon for an image gallery type solution for Jekyll.  I'm more interested in just an image repository for link to post, etc.

## Potential Day 6 Timeline
* Start researching Reverse Proxies for the homelab.Enter All previous Post for the 100 Days of Homelab Challenge
* Start building my new desk with the 6 foot butcher block counter top.
