# DAY 6

Well i\'ve managed to get the daily blog running for #100DaysofHomelab, so this is awesome.  I\'ve also added a "stickied" post to try the idea out.

The idea is to replace my PostIt\'s I virtually have all over my desk with a single location I can track everything. Hopefully its a good idea.

Also i\'ve found Geoff Greer\'s repo for 
[jekyll-gallery-generator](https://github.com/ggreer/jekyll-gallery-generator) i\'m going to attempt to merge into my Jekyll and see if I can get it running but I need to learn how to do this with github and not break everything.  Going to hitup iLude a fellow TechnoTim\'s Discord member and see if he can show me the ropes.

* **[COMPLETE]** Publish Jekyll out to github and get the website actually filled with content instead of placeholder text.
* **[IN-PROGRESS]** Found an Image Gallery Plugin for Jekyll I like.  Now i\'ve got to get it working with my site.  I have a feeling I\'m going to break many things today.

## Potential Day 7 Timeline
* Continue with the image gallery work for the Jekyll site
