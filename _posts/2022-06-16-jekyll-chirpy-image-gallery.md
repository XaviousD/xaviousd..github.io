# Jekyll with Chirpy theme Image Gallery process

Found an image gallery plugin I\'m going to attept to add into my Jekyll setup that uses the Chirpy theme.  I have NO CLUE how to do this but hopefully with some help from iLude later, I\'ll be able to document that process below.

Hopefully others who have taken on the #100DaysofHomelab challenge, and taken up the  
[#100DaysofHomelab](https://100daysofhomelab.com/) challenge and used TechnoTim\'s [Meet Jekyll](https://techno-tim.github.io/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) video to do their own blog will find this helpfull

More to Come...
