# DAY 7

With the help of iLude, jacobs, projectdp and Thunderfoot from TechnoTim\'s i\'ve managed to integrate ggreer\'s [jekyll-gallery-generator](https://github.com/ggreer/jekyll-gallery-generator) into my jekyll-chirpy setup.  To be honest, I was scarred but it was a rather painless process.

* **[COMPLETE]** Implement ggreer\'s gallery into the Jekyll-Chirpy theme.
* **[IN-PROGRESS]** Figure out how to add in a \'Image Vault\' Navigation Tab to the SideBar within Chirpy.  *WE have a team of people sitting in discord with me trying to figure this out*.

## Potential Day 8 Timeline
* Figure out how to add the Vault tab to my navigation pane on the Jekyll-Chirpy theme
* Build my new desk from the 6\' Butcher Block Counter Top I recently purchased
