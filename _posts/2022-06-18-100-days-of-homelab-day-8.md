# DAY 8

Played around with Jekyll-Chirpy a bit and I\'ve got the image-gallery working with the /vault/ url.  However the index.html file is being repleaced by a generic one that jekyll builds instead of the image-gallery one.  It has somethign to do with the templates but I can\'t figure out how/where to modify these. 

For now i\'m putting this as a 3/4 complete.  I\'ll come back to it at a later date.

* **[COMPLETE]** Implement ggreer\'s gallery into the Jekyll-Chirpy theme.
* **[COMPLETE]** Figure out how to add in a \'Image Vault\' Navigation Tab to the SideBar within Chirpy.  
* **[INPROGRESS]** Fix the template issues causing the /vault/index.html file so its correct and not blanks.

## Potential Day 9 Timeline
* Its Sunday, time to run backups. *I do not have this automated yet*
* Fix the template issues causing the /vault/index.html file so its correct and not blanks.
* Build my new desk from the 6\' Butcher Block Counter Top I recently purchased
