# DAY 11

Ordered an Intel Xeon E3-1231v3 CPU for the new R220.  Also ordered the 32gb of ECC RDIMM\'s a few days ago.  They all should get here around the same time.

Finally got around to building the new desk.

* **[COMPLETE]** Build my new desk from the 6\' Butcher Block Counter Top
* **[INPROGRESS]** Replace Dell r210ii with Dell r220.

## Potential Day 12 Timeline
* Fix the template issues causing the /vault/index.html file so its correct and not blanks.
* Update all firmware on the newly delivered Dell r220 in preerations for migrating r210ii Proxmox install with OPNSense and Pi-Hole to it.
