# DAY 25

Researching the best way to migrate my r210ii proxmox/vm\'s to my r220.  Not sure if I should just pull the ssd\'s and put them in the r220 and see how it boots up or if I should do a fresh install and remove the old proxmox from the cluster and add the new one.

* **[INPROGRESS]** Install 32gb RAM into the new r220.
* **[INPROGRESS]** Install CPU into the new r220.
* **[INPROGRESS]** Replace Dell r210ii with Dell r220.
* **[INPROGRESS]** Wrap old computer desk in the Vinyl Carbon Fiber Wrap
* **[INPROGRESS]** Pictures for Craigslist/Reddit Sales Threads
