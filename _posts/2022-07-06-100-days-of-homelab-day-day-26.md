# DAY 26

Today was a "Retail Therapy" day. Purchased some 10 foot DisplayPort and HBMI cables for the new desk along with a [WALI Triple LCD Monitor Desk Mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBL3PN3).  I will most likely keep the [HUANUO Dual Monitor Stand Mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CXJPQG9) for the work side of my desk and mount my 2 work monitors on it.
