# DAY 27

Ordered a new cooler, CRYORIG H7 Tower Cooler for the PC Conversion thats using the [SilverStone RM41-506 4u Chassis](https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/server-nas/RM41-506/).  Hopefully this will fit better then the [Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO](https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/coolers/cpu-air-coolers/hyper-212-evo/) that I originally purchases for the system way back when I built the gaming rig.
