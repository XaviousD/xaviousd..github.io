# DAY 28

Well, seeing as my 60Hz monitor from Dell doesn't have a standard VESA mount, I decided to order 2 more monitors.  Went with the [ViewSonic XG2405 144Hz](https://www.ebay.com/itm/394052187558) from Ebay Refurbished.  These will mainly be my side monitors as My ASUS Gaming monitor will still be the primary.
