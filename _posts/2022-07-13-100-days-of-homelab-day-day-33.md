# DAY 33

Got the CMOS Battery replaced in the 4u Server.  Then I went to put in the new 80mm fans but ran into some issues.  For some reason the fans come with the Molex power connections and I can't find the adapters I have.  Need to dig through my boxes of parts and locate them.  I\'ll try to locate them tomorrow. 

Went ahead and ran backups on everything.  I really need to automate this.  So much on the to-do list, so little time.

* **[COMPLETE]** Replace CMOS Battery in 4u Server
* **[INPROGRESS]** Replace Loud AF 80mm fans in the 4u Server with the new ones from Amazon
* **[INPROGRESS]** Replace Dell r210ii with Dell r220.

## Potential Day 34 Timeline
* Fix the template issues causing the /vault/index.html file so its correct and not blanks
* Replace Loud AF 80mm fans in the 4u Server with the new ones from Amazon
* Update all firmwares r220
* Pictures for Craigslist/Reddit Sales Threads
* Wait for the iDrac Module for the r220 to be delivered
