Finished up mounting the Wire-Management system on the new desk and got all the cables cleaned up.After that, I proceeded to moving my Linux ISO storage off of the SSD Array so I could add the 4th 500gb SSD. No hickups and finished this off late at night.Spent a few hours hanging out in TechnoTim's discord offering advice to a few new members looking to purchase their first server etc.When it comes to homelabbing, my rule of thumb is always, “Start with what you have.” then upgrade as you see fit. Taking the plunge and buying used Enterprise hardware can be a daunting task so take it slow with baby steps is my best advice to anyone looking to start homelabbing.Sunday I got back to work, but during the day I'm going to try and get my Dual-Monitor mount moved to my old desk and get all my work setup moved over so I can recover the space in my living room.

Yup, that's correct, the iDRAC module was on the way. Waiting patiently, by refreshing the delivery screen every 5 minutes, I surfed youtube and decided I would power down my TrueNAS VM and pull all my SSD's to run health checks on them and add labels with the date/health% on them for “bookkeeping”.DONE, iDRAC Module is in, didn't come with an Enterprise License so I had to install the 30 Day Trial while I figure out what to do about this. I don't really want to pay 50 bucks to some random ebay seller with a key-gen program.Bad News came shortly after ATTEMPTING to power on the r220. Stuck at Configuring Memory… This isn't good. After spending an hour swapping every configuration possible, reading documentation on the r220 and some google work. The Results, yup, ordered the incorrect ram. APARTENTLY the Dell r220's use Unregistered Ram. SO the (4) 8gb of 12800r RAM I just purchased will not work. Looking for (4) 8gb of 12800e now. Seems to be a unicorn, so this is cost a bit. Friday I'm going to pull the 16gb from my r210ii and see what it is and possible put the ram that the r220 came with in the r210ii and use the 16gb in the r220 until I can locate 32gb of Unregistered.With the r220 sporting the RAM it came with when purchased the new few hours were spent getting the BIOS on the r220 configured and upgrading all of the firmware.Next was to plug a 256gb SSD and all my Samsung EVO 500gb SSDs. Install Windows and run Samsung's SSD Utility and get health reports on all the SSD's. Decided to slap a piece of tape on each with the date and its Health Percentage. These SSD's will run pretty long as they run the Raid0 array i use for my torrents. Once the Linux ISO's are on the array they just sit there so the SSD's do not see much writing, just the random reads here and there. The array did consist of (3) 512gb SSD's but I have a 4th I'm adding, so I will need to move all the files off, delete the vdev in TrueNAS and rebuild it with the 4th SSD in it. I’ll do that this weekend.Listed the (4) Samsung 8GB 2Rx4 PC3L-12800R DDR3 on ebay. Hopefully I can recover some of the cost before finding the 12800r I need. Feel free to take a peak and send an offer if you need any ram.Tomorrow my monitors are due in and we can get the Tripple-Monitor Setup done.

Waiting on the 2 new monitors to get here this week, then I'll move the dual-monitor mount to the old desk and install the tri-monitor on the new wood desk.Next to-do was the r220 upgrades. FINALLY opened the box and pulled it out. It came with rails AND the faceplace. Really clean, no dust bunnies or anything. I did clean it just to make sure there was no residual dust. Installed the (4) 8gb sticks of ram, and the Xeon E3-1231v3 CPU. Yes i know the CPU is overkill for an Proxmox/OPNSense/PiHole setup. but it was cheap and I'm not to worried about power consumption.The only caveat is it did not come with the iDrac module. Found one on ebay for $45. Offered 35 and the seller auto-accepted. I hate when that happenes, because you think, could I of gone lower? Would it of auto-accepted also. LOL. So that will be here around Friday as well and then the process of moving from the r210ii to the r220 will continue.Added a few pics below from my partialy confied image gallery.
